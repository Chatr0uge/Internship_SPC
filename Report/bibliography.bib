  abstract = {A new 3D full-wave code, named CUWA, is developed to investigate the physics of RF wave propagation in the electron cyclotron frequency range in magnetised plasmas. The code utilises the Finite Difference Time Domain (FDTD) technique and takes advantage of massive parallel computations with Graphics Processing Units (GPU), which allows for a significant acceleration of the computations. As examples of code application we show 3D calculations of the linear transformation of ordinary to extraordinary electron-cyclotron waves and mode coupling in a sheared magnetic field. Thanks to its speed, the GPU-capable code allows for efficient and large parametric scans over a broad range of parameters.},

  abstract = {{The two-dimensional (2D) kinetic theory for a collisionless trapped electron mode is developed based on the Fourier-ballooning transform in an up-down symmetric equilibrium (illustrated via concentric circular magnetic surfaces). The system consists of two equations: the ballooning (integral) equation with a parameterized Floquet phase and a second order differential equation for the distribution of the Floquet phase. The coupled equations are, then, numerically solved as an eigenvalue problem yielding the 2D mode structure (in real space) as well as the global (phase-independent) eigenvalue for an L-mode parameter set. The 2D mode structure exhibits apparent radial-poloidal asymmetry; due to the poloidal coupling, the radial correlation length is found to be, at least, twice as large as the poloidal one. The global (phase-independent) eigenvalue of the mode differs considerably from the conventional local (phase-dependent) estimate. This paper shares many technical aspects with a published paper that works out the 2D kinetic theory for the ion temperature gradient mode [Xie et al., Phys. Plasmas 24, 102506 (2017)].}},

Control. Fusion  49 1019) are not sensitive to the average turbulence radial correlation length, but to a correlation length that depends on the binormal wavenumber  selected by the Doppler backscattering (DBS) signal. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations show that the turbulence naturally exhibits a nonseparable power law spectrum in wavenumber space, leading to a power law dependence of the radial correlation length with binormal wavenumber  which agrees with the inverse proportionality relationship between the measured  and  observed in experiments (Fernández-Marina et al 2014 Nucl. Fusion  54 072001). This new insight indicates that RCDR characterizes the eddy aspect ratio in the perpendicular plane to the magnetic field. It also motivates future use of a nonseparable turbulent spectrum to quantitatively interpret RCDR and potentially other turbulence diagnostics. The radial correlation length is only measurable when the radial resolution at the cutoff location  satisfies , while the measurement becomes dominated by  for . This suggests that  is likely to be inaccessible for electron-scale DBS measurements (). The effect of  on ion-scale radial correlation lengths could be nonnegligible.},

A stationary spectrum in the frequency range of drift waves is obtained using this equation by assuming a coexisting large amplitude long wavelength mode. The ω‐integrated k spectrum is given by k1.8(1+k2)−2.2, while the width of the frequency spectrum is proportional to k3(1+k2)−1, where k is normalized by cs/ωci.

  abstract  = {A first step towards the measurement of turbulence characteristics or transient events required for the understanding of turbulent transport is to build an interpretative model able to link the measurements of a given diagnostic to a wanted parameter of the turbulence, and simulation helps us to do that. To obtain density fluctuation parameters in fusion plasmas, microwaves can be used. However, the interpretation of the received signals requires generally sophisticated data processing to extract an exact evaluation of the wanted parameters. Simulations of electromagnetic wave propagation in turbulent plasmas permit to identify the main processes involved in probing wave-fluctuations interaction and the reflectometry signature of the expected events, which gives ideas to model them. It is shown here how simulations have permitted to exhibit the role of resonances of the probing wave induced by turbulence and to explain part of phase jumps seen during reflectometer measurements. The multi-scattering phenomena can be modelled by a photon diffusion equation which can be used to provide information on the turbulence at density fluctuations levels higher than allowed by usual methods. The reflectometry simulations show that at high level of turbulence a competition between the resonances generation mechanism, able to maintain the probing depth, and the Bragg backscattering exists. Its consequences on turbulence characterisation are discussed.}
