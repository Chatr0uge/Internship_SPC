First, the repartition of fluctuation energy over different spatial scales, as represented by the wavenumber spectrum, is investigated and a modification of the shape of the perpendicular wavenumber spectrum in the low wavenumber part of the spectrum is observed when changing collisionality. In addition, a new procedure to evaluate the dispersion relation of micro-turbulence is presented. From the behavior of the perpendicular mean velocity of density fluctuations with the perpendicular wavenumber, different dispersion relations are obtained between low and high collisionality cases.}},

    abstract = {A linear response, local model for the DBS amplitude applied to gyrokinetic simulations shows that radial correlation Doppler reflectometry measurements (RCDR, Schirmer et al 2007 Plasma Phys. Control. Fusion  49 1019) are not sensitive to the average turbulence radial correlation length, but to a correlation length that depends on the binormal wavenumber  selected by the Doppler backscattering (DBS) signal. Nonlinear gyrokinetic simulations show that the turbulence naturally exhibits a nonseparable power law spectrum in wavenumber space, leading to a power law dependence of the radial correlation length with binormal wavenumber  which agrees with the inverse proportionality relationship between the measured  and  observed in experiments (Fernández-Marina et al 2014 Nucl. Fusion  54 072001). This new insight indicates that RCDR characterizes the eddy aspect ratio in the perpendicular plane to the magnetic field. It also motivates future use of a nonseparable turbulent spectrum to quantitatively interpret RCDR and potentially other turbulence diagnostics. The radial correlation length is only measurable when the radial resolution at the cutoff location  satisfies , while the measurement becomes dominated by  for . This suggests that  is likely to be inaccessible for electron-scale DBS measurements (). The effect of  on ion-scale radial correlation lengths could be nonnegligible.},

    abstract = {{The two-dimensional (2D) kinetic theory for a collisionless trapped electron mode is developed based on the Fourier-ballooning transform in an up-down symmetric equilibrium (illustrated via concentric circular magnetic surfaces). The system consists of two equations: the ballooning (integral) equation with a parameterized Floquet phase and a second order differential equation for the distribution of the Floquet phase. The coupled equations are, then, numerically solved as an eigenvalue problem yielding the 2D mode structure (in real space) as well as the global (phase-independent) eigenvalue for an L-mode parameter set. The 2D mode structure exhibits apparent radial-poloidal asymmetry; due to the poloidal coupling, the radial correlation length is found to be, at least, twice as large as the poloidal one. The global (phase-independent) eigenvalue of the mode differs considerably from the conventional local (phase-dependent) estimate. This paper shares many technical aspects with a published paper that works out the 2D kinetic theory for the ion temperature gradient mode [Xie et al., Phys. Plasmas 24, 102506 (2017)].}},

In the regime where poloidal shearing exceeds turbulent radial scattering, a hybrid time scale weighted toward the former is found to govern the decorrelation process.

The turbulence quench mechanism is found to be insensitive to the sign of either the radial electric field or its shear.}},

A stationary spectrum in the frequency range of drift waves is obtained using this equation by assuming a coexisting large amplitude long wavelength mode. The ω‐integrated k spectrum is given by k1.8(1+k2)−2.2, while the width of the frequency spectrum is proportional to k3(1+k2)−1, where k is normalized by cs/ωci.

    abstract = {{This article describes the realization of a novel approach to short pulse (∼1 ns) reflectometry (SPR) recently implemented in the Tokamak à Configuration Variable. Taking advantage of a fast arbitrary waveform generator and vector-network-analyzer extension modules, the design offers flexibility regarding pulse output frequency, duration, and repetition rate. Such flexibility allows the instrument to overcome traditional SPR spatial sampling limitations while reducing hardware complexity. In order to measure the group-delay of nanosecond-scale pulses, both traditional analog and novel digital sampling techniques have been explored. A group-delay range resolution of 17 ps (2.6 mm) in average over the V-band has been achieved with both timing techniques against a waveguide mirror featuring 10 dB power fluctuations. Direct pulse sampling during L-mode plasmas shows that reflected pulse widths increase only by 4\\% in average. However, pulse width dispersion does occur in L-mode plasmas and leads to an increase in the group-delay uncertainty up to 40 ps (6 mm). Raw histograms of group-delay data show interesting qualitative changes from the L mode to the H-mode. Frequency spectra of group-delay data allow the identification of macroscopic density fluctuations as well as edge quasicoherent modes during edge-localized mode-free H-modes. Finally, fast changes to the density profile have been measured with microsecond time resolution and subcentimeter spatial resolution in both O and X-mode polarizations.}},
